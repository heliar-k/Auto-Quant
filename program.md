# Auto-Quant v0.2.0 — multi-strategy autonomous research

This is an experiment to have the LLM do its own quantitative research across
**multiple parallel strategies**, not just iterate on one.

The core bet of v0.2.0: since backtests are cheap and single-strategy iteration
tends to anchor on a single paradigm (see `versions/0.1.0/retrospective.md`),
maintaining up to 3 strategies simultaneously should resist anchoring and
produce a richer picture of what genuinely works on this asset pair.

## Setup

To set up a new experiment, work with the user to:

1. **Agree on a run tag**: propose a tag based on today's date (e.g. `may1`).
   The branch `autoresearch/<tag>` must not already exist.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<tag>` from current `master`.
3. **Read the in-scope files**. The repo is small. Read these files for full context:
   - `README.md` — repository context
   - `config.json` — fixed FreqTrade config (pairs, timeframe, fees). Do not modify.
   - `prepare.py` — data download. Do not modify.
   - `run.py` — the batch backtest oracle. Do not modify.
   - `user_data/strategies/_template.py.example` — skeleton for new strategies.
     **Note:** the folder may also contain `__pycache__`; ignore it.
   - `versions/0.1.0/retrospective.md` — optional but valuable context on
     what the previous run discovered and what went wrong with single-file
     iteration.
4. **Verify data exists**: Check that `user_data/data/BTC_USDT-1h.feather` and
   `user_data/data/ETH_USDT-1h.feather` exist. If not, tell the user to run
   `uv run prepare.py`.
5. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row:
   ```
   commit	event	strategy_name	sharpe	max_dd	note
   ```
   Tab-separated. Do not commit this file — it's gitignored on purpose.
6. **Create 1-3 starting strategies.** This is the most important setup step.
   - Each strategy goes in its own file: `user_data/strategies/<YourName>.py`
   - Class name MUST match filename stem (FreqTrade requirement)
   - Each strategy's docstring MUST fill all 5 metadata fields
     (Paradigm, Hypothesis, Parent, Created, Status)
   - **Each strategy MUST target a different paradigm.** Don't create 3
     mean-reversion variants as a "safe start" — that defeats the whole point
     of v0.2.0. Pick from: mean-reversion, trend-following, volatility,
     breakout, other. At least 2 different categories.
   - Keep each strategy minimal initially. You'll iterate in the loop.
7. **Confirm and go**: Confirm setup looks good with the user.

Once you get confirmation, kick off the experimentation.

## Experimentation

Each round runs a backtest on ALL active strategies on a **fixed timerange**
(`20230101-20251231`) over BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT at 1h. `run.py` emits one
`---` summary block per strategy.

### What you CAN do

- Modify any file under `user_data/strategies/` (that isn't prefixed `_`)
- Create a new strategy file
- Delete a strategy file (via `git rm`)
- Copy an existing strategy to create a variant (fork)

### What you CANNOT do

- Modify `prepare.py`, `run.py`, or `config.json`. These are the evaluation
  contract.
- `uv add` new dependencies. Use what's already in `pyproject.toml`.
- Call the `freqtrade` CLI directly. The only way to run backtests is via
  `uv run run.py`.
- Modify the timerange, pair list, or `_template.py.example`.
- Have more than 3 active strategies at any time (see hard cap below).

### Hard rules on strategy lifecycle

**Rule 1: Hard cap — 3 active strategies.**
At any moment, `user_data/strategies/` must contain at most 3 non-underscore
`.py` files. To add a 4th, you must first `git rm` one of the existing.

**Rule 2: Stagnation gate — 3 stable rounds.**
Each round, every strategy gets one of these events logged in `results.tsv`:
- `create` — you added it this round
- `evolve` — you modified it this round
- `stable` — it existed, got measured, but you didn't touch it
- `fork` — you copied it to create a derivative (logged on the child, with
  `parent→child` in the strategy_name field)
- `kill` — you removed it this round

**If a strategy has accumulated 3 consecutive `stable` events with no `evolve`
or `fork`, the next round it MUST receive one of: `evolve`, `fork`, or `kill`.**
Cannot sit idle for a 4th stable round. You decide which treatment. This rule
exists because the cap is 3 — we can't afford a slot sitting still.

**Rule 3: Every round must touch at least one strategy.**
A round where all events are `stable` is not an experiment — it's wasted time.
At minimum, evolve one strategy per round. (Exception: the very first backtest
round right after setup, where you log `create` events for what you built.)

**Rule 4: Paradigm diversity at setup.**
See setup step 6 above. First 1-3 strategies must target different paradigms.
After that, you're free to create same-paradigm variants (e.g. two
mean-reversion approaches with different signals) — but sparingly. Diversity
is more valuable than depth in this run.

## Output format

Once `run.py` finishes, stdout has one `---` block per strategy, like:

```
---
strategy:         MeanRevRSI
commit:           abc1234
timerange:        20230101-20251231
sharpe:           0.8234
sortino:          1.0412
calmar:           0.5821
total_profit_pct: 45.3210
max_drawdown_pct: -8.9123
trade_count:      142
win_rate_pct:     54.2300
profit_factor:    1.6700
pairs:            BTC/USDT,ETH/USDT

---
strategy:         TrendDonchian
commit:           abc1234
...
```

If a strategy crashes, its block looks like:
```
---
strategy:         SomeBrokenStrategy
commit:           abc1234
status:           ERROR
error_type:       NameError
error_msg:        name 'foo' is not defined
traceback:
  ...
```

Extract all strategies' metrics at once:
```bash
grep "^---\|^strategy:\|^sharpe:\|^trade_count:\|^max_drawdown_pct:" run.log
```

Full per-strategy block:
```bash
awk '/^---$/,/^$/' run.log
```

## Logging results

After each round, append one row to `results.tsv` **per strategy touched**.
Tab-separated, 6 columns:

```
commit	event	strategy_name	sharpe	max_dd	note
```

Rules:
- `commit` is the short git hash of the round's commit
- `event` is one of `create | evolve | stable | fork | kill`
- For `fork`, `strategy_name` uses `parent→child` format (e.g. `MeanRevRSI→MRVolGate`)
- For `kill`, leave `sharpe` and `max_dd` as `-` (dash). The strategy is gone.
- `note` is your reasoning in free text. This is load-bearing — when you
  later decide keep vs kill, you re-read these notes. Be specific:
  - Bad: `"tried MACD, didn't work"`
  - Good: `"replaced RSI entry with MACD cross-up. wr 68→51, sharpe 0.82→0.31. MACD crossovers on 1h crypto trigger inside ongoing drops, catching knives. Discarding paradigm."`
- Every strategy that exists this round gets a row, even if `stable`. This
  is how the stagnation counter stays visible.

**Do NOT commit `results.tsv`.** It is gitignored on purpose — the log
survives `git reset --hard`, which is essential so you don't forget what
you've already tried.

## The experiment loop

The experiment runs on the dedicated branch (e.g. `autoresearch/may1`).

LOOP FOREVER:

1. **Look at state**: read `results.tsv` (tail ~30 rows), note the current
   active strategies and their stagnation counters (how many consecutive
   `stable` events each has).

2. **Decide this round's action.** Your toolkit per round:
   - `evolve <strategy>`: modify an existing strategy file
   - `create <name>`: add a new strategy (if cap has room)
   - `fork <parent>→<child>`: cp a strategy file to a new name, then modify
     the child
   - `kill <strategy>`: `git rm` the file
   - You can combine: e.g. "kill A and create B in the same commit" (make room
     for something new), or "fork A→A' and evolve B" (two strategies touched)

3. **Respect the rules.** In particular:
   - Cap: max 3 active strategies after this round's changes
   - Stagnation: any strategy with 3 prior consecutive `stable` events must
     be evolved, forked, or killed THIS round
   - Every round touches ≥ 1 strategy

4. **Make the code changes.** Write/modify files under `user_data/strategies/`.

5. **`git commit -am "<short summary of this round>"`**

6. **Run the backtest**: `uv run run.py > run.log 2>&1`

7. **Read the summary**: `awk '/^---$/,/^$/' run.log` (shows all blocks) or
   `grep "^---\|^strategy:\|^sharpe:\|^trade_count:" run.log` (compact).

8. **Check for crashes**: a strategy with `status: ERROR` needs to be fixed
   (if the error is trivial — syntax, typo) OR killed (if the hypothesis is
   broken). Don't leave ERROR strategies around.

9. **Log to results.tsv**: one row per strategy that existed this round. Fill
   in the event, metrics (or `-` for kills), and your reasoning note.

10. **Decide keep vs rollback.**
    - Common case: per-strategy decisions happen inline (you either evolved
      to something better, or the change was bad and you git-reset only that
      strategy's commit). The whole round doesn't have one "keep/discard"
      decision — individual strategies do.
    - If the whole round was a mistake (broke everything, wrong direction),
      `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to undo all changes.
    - If some strategies improved and others didn't: keep the commit, log
      `stable` for the unchanged ones, log `evolve` or `kill` etc. for the
      changed ones.

11. **Loop.**

### Deciding keep vs kill on a strategy

A strategy deserves to stay if:
- It has positive edge (Sharpe > 0, profit factor > 1) with meaningful trade
  count (>20 trades over 3 years)
- Its paradigm is distinct from what the other active strategies cover
- Recent evolutions have moved it in the right direction

A strategy deserves to die if:
- It's been stable for 3 rounds with no improvement and you don't have a new
  idea for it
- Its paradigm overlaps strongly with another active strategy that's doing
  better
- You need its slot for a fresh paradigm you want to try
- It's consistently negative and further tweaks won't help (e.g. wrong
  timeframe for this paradigm)

**Always log your reasoning.** These notes become the v0.2.0 retrospective —
future you (and the meta-analysis layer) will read them to extract what this
run actually learned about BTC/ETH 1h.

### Goodhart watch

From v0.1.0 we learned the agent can inadvertently game the metric:
- `exit_profit_only=True` → 100% win rate by never realizing losses
  (regime-dependent, breaks in bear markets)
- Tight `minimal_roi` clipping → tiny uniform returns → low stddev → huge
  Sharpe (profit goes DOWN even as Sharpe goes UP)

If you find a Sharpe jump that comes with a profit drop or a DD collapse to
~0, that's a gaming signal, not real edge. Log it, document the mechanism,
then either kill the strategy or explicitly note "this is an oracle artifact,
not edge" in the description.

Multi-strategy helps here: if strategy A's Sharpe jumps while B and C stay
flat on the same data, A's jump is more likely a real discovery. If ALL
three strategies' Sharpe jumped on the same commit — you probably modified
something shared, or the oracle itself has a hole.

**Timeout**: each full round (3 strategies × backtest) should take under 3
minutes. If a single run exceeds 10 minutes, kill it and treat it as a
failure (revert the commit, skip the round).

### NEVER STOP

Once the experiment loop has begun (after initial setup), do NOT pause to
ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep going?" or
"is this a good stopping point?". The human may be asleep, or away from
the computer, and expects you to continue working *indefinitely* until
manually stopped.

If you run out of ideas:
- **Re-read the `versions/0.1.0/retrospective.md`** — it lists directions
  v0.1.0 never tried (multi-timeframe, ATR dynamic exits, volatility regime,
  per-pair customization, time-of-day effects)
- Look at your stagnant strategies — can you fork them with a bolder change?
- Try combining winners from different paradigms (e.g. a volatility-gated
  version of a winning mean-reversion strategy)
- Try completely new indicator families you haven't touched

The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.

As an example use case, a user might leave you running while they sleep.
Each round of 3-strategy backtests takes ~2-3 minutes, so you can run several
dozen per hour. The user then wakes up to a rich multi-strategy research
trace ready for meta-analysis.
